# pyconau18-flip-flop-faceofferator

On Saturday evening at PyCon Australia '18, we heard some inspiring talks.

Two of them inspired several people to implement Ruby's flip-flop operator
(*"The Flip-Floperator"*) for Python - a life-saving move when it will soon
be removed from Ruby!

This repo holds several such implementations, which (if it is accepted) will
be presented in a collaborative lightening talk by @mermop (et al, 2018).
